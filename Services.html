      Once the gap is targeted, Organica will focus on introducing a full
      organic makeup line. Its sole purpose will be to cater every skin tone and
      type (sensitive skin, dry skin, oily skin etc.) .As majority of makeup
      line does not include spf which is essential for protection from harmful
      sun rays, all of our makeup products will contain spf (sun protection
      factor) 50. Spf is important as it protects from skin cancer,
      discoloration and wrinkle formation.
