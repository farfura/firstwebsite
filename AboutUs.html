    <p>
      Three words to describe us: feminine, fun and bright. Organica skincare is
      a newly established cruelty free and environmental friendly brand launched
      in 2022.it was brought to life when I was in my third semester of my
      university. My extreme level of interest and after over 4 years of
      thsoroughly studying about organic skincare and having done diploma in it,
      I’ve released wide collection of skin care products ranging from facial
      oils, nail oils, eyelashes serum to body butters!
